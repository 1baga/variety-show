### 📝 Define and Describe Recursion

The process in which a function calls itself directly or indirectly is called recursion and the corresponding function is called as recursive function.

Recursive algorithms break down a problem into smaller pieces which you either already know the answer to, or can solve by applying the same algorithm to each piece, and then combining the results.

### 📝 Define and Describe the Base Case and General Case

#### Base Case

The base case, or halting case, of a function is the problem that we know the answer to, that can be solved without any more recursive calls. The base case is what stops the recursion from continuing on forever.

#### General Case

The general case is what happens most of the time, and is where the recursive call takes place.
